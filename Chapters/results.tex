%begynne med signaturer - konkludere med at disse er påvirket av farge - videre til pca, konkludere med at ja, fargen dominerer absolutt over material composition, men det er lightness som gjelder...

In this chapter, the results from the laboratory testing are presented. The first results are the presented raw data retrieved directly from the hyperspectral imager(spectrometer). The data is plotted as a wave spectra, displaying the specific spectral signatures of the tested microplastic. Based on the same set of data, principal component analyses have been conducted, handling the data one step further. The second results are therefore plots from the principal component analyses, first conducted with microplastic alone, before running an additional analysis, adding biological components to the test set. The results will be presented, compared and discussed throughout this chapter.

\section{Signatures}
The following section will present, discuss and compare a representative set of signatures. The set was chosen based on similar traits and their explanatory ability. The full set of signatures is available in Appendix \ref{app:signatures}.

\subsection{Constant Color}
As previously mentioned, the plastic samples had a variety of additives, one of which where colorants causing some of the samples to have distinct colors. The resulting signatures were highly affected by the color of the targeted plastic pellets. Figure \ref{fig:plastcomp1}, shows the spectrum of two types, PP and PVC respectively.

\noindent
As can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:plastcomp1}, the signatures of the two types are almost identical, with a possibility of deviations due to measurements errors. From Section \ref{sec:microplastic}, we know for a fact that the structure of these two are very different. PP contains several monomers with the chemical formula of $C_3H_6$, while PVC has monomers with the following formula, $C_2H_3Cl$, even containing additional chlorine-atoms, Cl.  The large similarity between the two samples, despite their highly different chemical composition does argue in favor of there either being a general signature, or simply that the samples are of the same color. From the pictures of the samples it is possible to see that the two samples are highly similar. In combination with the results seen below, it is hard to argue that the similarity is due to anything other than the equivalent color of the samples. 


\subsection{Various Colors}
The results from the more colorful pieces of microplastics are presented below. Figures \ref{fig:green}, \ref{fig:red} and \ref{fig:blue} display the resulting signatures of green-colored PE-HD, red-colored PE-HD and blue-colored PE-LD, with their associated peak wavelength circled on the visible light spectrum.

\noindent
This result support the earlier assertion about the color being dominant when detecting the spectral image of the plastic. Even though Figures \ref{fig:green} and \ref{fig:red} present results from the same type of plastic, PE-HD, there are not much resemblance in the plots. In summation, there are clear indications that the main feature described by the hyper spectral spectra is the color of the samples. In the following section the results from the PCA will be presented further investigating if there are any clear distinctions.
\\\\
%The color variation is also found from the PCA as the second principal component. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the specific color has a large influence.
In order to obtain a color-free spectrum, one idea could be to subtract the color spectrum from the resulting spectrum retrieved from the experiments. However, most pieces of plastic do not have one specific color, making it difficult to determine the spectrum to subtract. Another argument disagreeing with this is the comparison of the un-colored plastic types, revealing no signature difference for different types of plastic. Nevertheless, this argument alone is not enough to dismiss the idea of subtraction. 


\subsection{Various Sizes}
Another interesting comparison is the result of the same type of plastic, in different sizes. In this section, illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:size}, a clear empty bottle of Farris, existent of PET-plastic, is compared to clear PET Amorphous. The pieces of PET Amorphous are 3mm thick, while the piece from the bottle is significantly larger.

\end{figure}
\noindent
When comparing the resulting signatures above, it is clear that they share trends. A quick look at Figure \ref{fig:size} reveals many similarities. Nevertheless, looking at the y-axis displaying intensity, one can observe a tripled intensity from the microplastic. This might be due to the thickness of the samples. The light will have traveled through the plastic and reflected of the background. As previously mentioned, the thickness of the medium penetrated by the light affects the intensity of the light. Another reason might be due to processing of the plastic. Even though the samples are of the same type, the commercial use in the bottle could have required processing causing the plastic to be less light-permeable.
\\\\
When experimenting with different types of plastics having more or less the same colors, the results turned out next to identical. At first, a thought was that this was due to the color being too dominant in relation to the rest of the properties. However, conducting the same experiment with non-colored pieces of plastic, gave the same end-result; no difference in spectral signature even if the types of plastics differ. The visible light may not be able to identify the chemical differences in the materials and therefore is not able to yield distinct signatures for the individual types.


\section{Principal Component Analysis}

As mentioned in the previous sections, the results from scanning the plastic samples using hyper spectral imaging, are presented in plots. For each analysis, the plots retrieved from the PCA, executed using the R programming, are mainly a scatter plot and a contribution plot. 
\\\\
The following two sections will present and discuss the tested variables previously presented in Chapter \ref{chap:method}. 

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis with all Plastic Samples}\label{sec:pcafull}
Figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_only_full_scat} is a scatter plot of the initial dataset. The horizontal axis describes the first principal component (PC1) and the percentage of the variables it explains. Similar, the vertical axis describes the second principal component (PC2) and its percentage for explained variables. The rings circling clusters with the same color, or samples of the same type, are the 95\% confidence interval of the type. This way, 95\% of the samples should be located within this ring. The scatter plot should therefore clearly indicate whether there are any clusters depicting patterns in the sample data. Finally, the colored arrows on the circle centered in (0, 0) depict the direction of the increasing level of that color. The direction retrieved by following the red arrow indicate an increasing level of the color red in the sample, while the direction of the blue arrow indicate an increasing level of the color blue, and so on.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \caption{Scatter plot of the results of the PCA with all plastic samples}
    \label{fig:PCA_plastics_only_full_scat}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Images/results/PCA_plastics_full_list.png}
  \caption{List of all scanned plastic samples and their respective colors.}
  \label{fig:PCA_plastics_full_list}
\end{figure}
\noindent
As can be seen of the plot in Figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_only_full_scat}, PC1 accounts for over 94.1\% of the variance, while PC2 explains no more that 3.4\% of the variance. Interpreting the plot, there are two main clusters in the scatter plot. The low explained percentage of the vertical axis results in only the horizontal position of the clusters being taken into account. The far left measurements are of clear plastics, white paper and white plastics. Due to the clearness of the plastic one assumes the resulting spectrum is largely due to the white paper background reflecting through. These samples are therefore deemed to be non-representative.
\\\\
Figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_full_doub_cont} shows the contributions from the different wavelengths corresponding with the two principal components. The horizontal axis represent the wavelengths and the vertical axis the contribution in percent. The dashed red line represent 0.253\% or the line that shows the exact equal contribution from all wavelengths. Integrating the line would result in $0.253\% \cdot (700 - 400)/(0.758) \approx 100\%$. Also, the color of the line depicts the color at that wavelength, the blue color of the line at 450 nm is the color of light with that specific wavelength. 
\\\\
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/results/PCA_plastics_full_doub_cont.png}
    \caption{Contribution plot of the results of the PCA with all plastic samples.}
    \label{fig:PCA_plastics_full_doub_cont}
\end{figure}
\noindent
From the signature and contribution of PC1 in Figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_full_doub_cont} it is apparent that the 94.1\% descriptive property of the first principal component is not rooted in one wave length or in a combination of wavelengths. The even distribution over the spectrum visualize the fact that PC1 mainly describes the \textit{lightness} of the plastic.
\\\\
The far left position of the cluster in figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_only_full_scat} being a result of the plastic shining through is further underlined by PC1 mainly reflecting the lightness of the samples. This fact also supports the exclusion of the samples, as their measurements are not a product of the sample's inherent properties.
\\\\
In addition, the position of the different samples in Figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_only_full_scat}, also indicate that the results are dominated by this fact. Due to the low variance of the second principal component, of only 3.4\%, the vertical spread and thus the few clusters there are, are not well described and may not be deemed representative.

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis with Reduced Plastic Samples}
As explained in the previous section, the results presented in this section are from a reduced dataset. Based on the knowledge provided through analyzing the results of the full set, some variables were removed. This way, the reduced set contains only relevant redeemed variables without wrongly measured samples possibly pulling the result in the wrong direction. 
\\\\
Figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_reduced_only_scat} is the scatter plot describing this reduced set. The properties of this scatter plot are the same as for the scatter plot presented for Figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_only_full_scat} in Section \ref{sec:pcafull}, and will therefore not be elaborated here as well.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/results/PCA_plastics_reduced_only_scat.png}
    \caption{Results of the PCA with reduced Plastic Samples}
    \label{fig:PCA_plastics_reduced_only_scat}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Images/results/PCA_plastics_reduced_list.png}
    \caption{List of the reduced scanned plastic samples and their respective colors.}
    \label{fig:PCA_plastics_reduced_list}
\end{figure}
\noindent
PC1 now represents 80.1\% of the variance, while PC2 explains 13.4\% of the variance. Despite the lower explanation percentage of PC2, there are clusters. The percentage is sufficiently high to make a contribution in the plot worth noting. Therefore, the vertical spread is deemed representative, as opposed to the previous section. As a result, there are more significant clusters. These are quite apparent in the top and bottom of the scatter plot (\ref{fig:PCA_plastics_reduced_only_scat}). 
\\\\
The issue arise when comparing these clusters to their respective plastic type. There are no other clear clusters related to these types of plastic. In fact, it seems that the clear clusters these types are a part of, are based on the color of the plastic, not inherent properties of the material. The bottom cluster consists of PE Recyclate of the color blue together with samples retrieved from the blue part of the logo on a plastic bag. Similarly, the top cluster consists of PE Regrind and PE Yellow Fish Box Beached Texel, both of which are yellow-colored. It is therefore difficult to argue that these clusters indicate anything other than the color additives in the material. Which combines well with the tendencies illustrated when comparing the peaks of the colored plastics with their respective color.
\\\\
Based on the tendency of the clear plastic to be on the left side of the cluster in combination with aforementioned tendency of PC1 explaining the \textit{lightness} of the samples, one can assume that the white paper background have had an impact on the measurements, and subsequently on the principal components. The samples of PS Pristine were particularly clear, as may be seen from the table in the Section \ref{sec:material} in Chapter \ref{chap:method}, or as an image in Appendix \ref{app:image_plast}. Given that these are the main contributions to the spread along the horizontal axis, one could argue that without the light background, the lightness and clearness of the material would be less prominent in the first principal component. This would possibly further change the composition of the principal components and subsequently change the patterns on the scatter plots. 
\\\\
\noindent
The associated contribution plot of the reduced data set is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_doub_cont}. This plot show how the different wavelength contribute in correspondence to PC1 and PC2, respectively.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Images/results/PCA_plastics_reduced_doub_cont.png}
    \caption{Contribution plots of the two principal components of the PCA with reduced plastic samples}
    \label{fig:PCA_plastics_doub_cont}
\end{figure}
\noindent
The contribution plot of the second principal component imply that the lower end of the spectrum has had a larger impact than the larger wavelengths.

\subsection{Principal Component Analysis with Biological Components}
Figures \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_and_biology_scat} and \ref{fig:PCA_and_bio_cont_plots} are plots describing the results of plastic samples together with biological pigments - initially presented at the end of Chapter \ref{chap:method}. These plots have the same properties as those above, solely consisting of plastic.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\noindent
Interpreting these figures, a more prominent trend became apparent. The natural occurring pigment in algae and crustaceans differed from the plastic in the scatter plot. This shows potential for distinguishing plastic in general from organic pigments naturally occurring in the marine environment.
\\\\
The contribution on the first principal component does not differ much from the associated components in the previous plots. However, given the mentioned effect of the clear plastic, this might change with the use of a less reflective background. Furthermore, in Figure \ref{fig:PCA_plastics_and_biology_scat} all plastic samples are gathered in one confidence interval ring. The result is that the previously mentioned clear plastic lies outside the confidence interval. This would further underline the previous suspicion that there is a prominent effect from the white background on the results.
\\\\
Experience has shown that the brightness/lightness of the samples is highly relevant also when not investigating plastic. Therefore, a change in background might affect the results, but it is not expected to have a drastic effect. The results are therefore still deemed valid.
\\\\
Despite seeing a resemblance of a signature in the second principal component it is important to keep in mind the components do not represent actual signatures. They rather depict the wavelengths which have a larger influence on the vertical distinguishing of the samples.
\\\\
Based on the absence of clear clusters it was deemed not possible to acquire what is thought of as unique signatures for the plastic. All three analyses do show vertical spread, but the large number of overlapping samples made it difficult to argue for the existence of clear signatures at this stage. In the analysis with the presence of the organic pigments, there are some indication of separation, but not enough to argue in favor of a general signature for the plastic. However, the clustering seen in the sample does pose an opportunity of distinguishing plastic from the natural occurring pigments. 

\section{Sources of Error}
Due to the ambient environment and sensors related to hyperspectral imaging, noise will be next to impossible to exclude. There will always be some dark noise due to the sensors of the system. Also, since the measured values are based on a ratio rather than absolute values, even the smallest of changes could have a large outcome due to the fact that the values are divided by extremely small values. A change in the divisor may be small, but due to the relative change, the outcome can be changed drastically. However, the biggest variation were in the infrared or near-infrared spectrum. Since these test were limited to the visible spectrum, the variations were of such a magnitude that the results were satisfactory with respect to changes caused by noise. 
\\\\
Furthermore, the ambient light in the room is hard to completely avoid. Even though all light were turned off and blinds were used, some light still got in. The light will affect the results, and could possibly affect the signature. However, due to the low amount of lighting that were present during the tests, it is assumed to not have a considerable effect on the results. The ambient light is therefore assumed to be negligible. 
\\\\
Even though the plastics were specially ordered as pure samples, some parts of the material and its manufacturing, are unknown. As a result, the results could be affected by the differences in the plastic composition made by the manufacturer. However, the results showed a clear tendency where the actual color of the plastic was dominant as opposed to the chemical composition.
\\\\
The see-through plastic will be affected by the background. Compensation for the paper background was not performed, and the results were possibly affected by the background. The effect is not completely clear, but the trend showing the see-through plastics and the white paper peaking at similar wavelengths indicates the effect of the background. On the other hand, the background would most likely affect the results of the clear plastic either way. Therefore, the results were deemed satisfactory with the white background.
\\\\
The scanning was easily affected by the movement of the scanner. This was portrayed in the change of the reflectance standard. It is therefore a concern that the same effect will have caused the signatures to be inconsistent. However, the reflectance was regularly updated and there was several measurements per plastic type in order to account for large individual variations. It is still a concern that single measurements that were affected could skew the results.

\section{Additional remarks}
Based on the presented results, it is hard to make the case of an universal signature for plastic or using hyperspectral imaging to classify plastic. However, as mentioned earlier, experiments analyzing the wave spectra of different types of plastics, have already been conducted, and unique wave spectrum has been confirmed. Nevertheless, the results have been directed towards viewing the wavelength interval describing near infrared light (NIR). Although the use of infrared light is an effective means of unobtrusive observation on land, it is far less effective in the ocean because light in the infrared spectra is more rapidly attenuated by seawater. One can therefore discuss whether it in fact would be possible to detect microplastic underwater using NIR light.
\\\\
A possible solution would be to push the boundaries of the measured light. One could try to measure the wavelengths as close to NIR as possible. By trying to greatly reduce the distance from the spectrometer to the sample volume, the attenuation will be reduced. This might make it possible to identify the plastic using wavelengths of greater length in order to classify the plastic, but at such a distance that the light is not absorbed.
