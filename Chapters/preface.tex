\chapter*{Preface}
This thesis is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of master of science (MSc) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The main work is conducted at Department of Marine Technology, NTNU, while part of the work has been conducted at the Department of Biology, NTNU in cooperation with Aksel Mogstad. 
\\\\
I have cooperated with Andreas Stien in large part. Next to all testing and work done hands on, have been done together with Andreas. Therefore we share more or less the same method and results. In addition, Andreas and I will work together for the masters thesis starting next year. The section regarding further work should therefore also be equally written. 
\\\\
This semester, I have had two very relevant module courses, TTK19 Structures and Contexts in Complex Systems -  a course on how to handle Quantitative Big Data, and TTK20 Hyperspectral remote sensing - describing the hyperspectral imaging process. Throughout these courses, I have gained much relevant knowledge, some reflected in this thesis.
