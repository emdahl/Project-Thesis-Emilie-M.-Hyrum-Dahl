....
The results from the Principal Component Analysis of the measurements showed no clear clusters or trends that would make it possible to distinguish individual types of plastic at this stage. As PC1 represents the latent variable lightness and PC2 the latent variable color, the resulting correlation and variation in the set was not due to IOP from material composition..


\section{Further Work}
The further work on this project will be to complete the master thesis.
