\chapter{Conclusion and Further Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}
The research question asked at the beginning of this thesis was... This chapter will give a conclusion answering the research question, pulling strings from the result and discussion. In this project thesis, one objective was to do the necessary preparations for a master thesis that will be written and delivered in the spring of 2019. With this in mind, a tentative plan for further work, is expressed at the end of this chapter. 


\section{Conclusion}
The research question asked at the beginning of this thesis was: \textit{Is it possible to identify plastics using a spectrometer in the visual spectrum?} Throughout experimental work and analysis, the answer has revealed itself. A correlation and clustering within the provided data was found. However, these were based on the lightness and color of the objects, not the IOP from material composition. As neither the Principal Components Analysis nor interpretation of the signatures directly, revealed a distinct signature for plastics, it was not possible to distinguish individual types of plastic nor plastic in general with the use of spectroscopy.
\\\\
Based on the presented results and discussion it has become clear that identifying plastics based on hyperspectral imaging in the visible spectrum is not possible at this point. 

\section{Further Work}
The further work on this project will be to complete the master thesis.
