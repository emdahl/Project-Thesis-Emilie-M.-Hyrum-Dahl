\chapter*{Abstract}

The ocean plays a great part in life on earth, not only as a source to oxygen and food for living beings, but also as a vital influence to the climate and weather. The ocean, with all that comes with it, is simply a necessity for life on earth. Nevertheless, this same ocean is not taken care of. Millions of pieces of plastics, especially micro-plastic, pollutes and eradicate sea life every day, indirectly affecting life on land. 
\\\\
The road to a clean sea can be divided into steps. First step is to prevent the continuous supply of trash and plastic pollution. The next step should involve picking up what is already in the ocean. The latter action is further divided into sub-steps. As ocean is huge, attacking all parts of the sea is next to impossible. Being able to map and monitor the ocean columns and determine critical areas is thus a good start. Therefore, this thesis will concern methods for detection and analyzing micro-plastics.
